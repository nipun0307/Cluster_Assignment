Hi Mahika!
Hope you can see this :)

I think we can possibly checkout the following resources: 
    https://oridomi.com/#features -> GitHub : https://github.com/dmotz/oriDomi

This is more of an advanced curve generating library, but worth a look : http://paperjs.org/about/
Nonetheless, oriDomi is better

I am having trouble initialising and installing oriDomi. Let me know if you are able to do this -- Done

Nevermind, oriDomi is not the right tool. It just creates a paper folding effect for things
