Hi Mahika!
Hope you can see this :)

I think we can possibly checkout the following resources: 
    https://oridomi.com/#features -> GitHub : https://github.com/dmotz/oriDomi

This is more of an advanced curve generating library, but worth a look : http://paperjs.org/about/
Nonetheless, oridomi is better
